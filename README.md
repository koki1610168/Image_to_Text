# Image to Text

This program is simple. It takes a photo from your cam, and derive text from the photo.
I used cv2 to take a photo, and extract text using pyocr.

**Version 1.0.0**

```
  git clone https://github.com/koki1610168/Image_to_Text.git
```

To execute this code, you can just type following command in your terminal - you might need to install some libraries though.
'''
  python take_photo.py
'''
Take photo with your space bar, and finish the program with escape key.

You will get something like this.
